I am an Assistant Professor of Robotics and AI in the Department of Computer and Software Engineering at [Polytechnique Montréal](https://polymtl.ca/) (engineering school of the [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/)). Prior to becoming a professor, I completed a PhD at Polytechnique Montréal, during which I was a visiting researcher at the [Mobile Robotics Group](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/mobile-robotics-group/) at the University of Oxford and the [SPARK Lab](https://web.mit.edu/sparklab/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), as well as a research intern at [Samsung Research America](https://sra.samsung.com/).

My research focuses on autonomous robotics, with an emphasis on 3D perception, computer vision, distributed systems, and artificial intelligence applied to multi-robot networks.

## Research interests:

- Spatial AI
- Collaborative SLAM and multi-robot perception
- Machine learning for robotics
- Sensor fusion and localization in complex environments
- Planning and coordination of autonomous robotic teams
- Applications in space robotics, automated manufacturing, and service robotics.

## Prospective Students

I am looking for highly motivated and curious students with a strong background in programming, AI and/or robotics to work on scene understanding, perception, and learning for autonomous robotics in uncertain environments.

If you are interested in working with me, please send: your CV, transcripts, and a brief summary of your research interests.
